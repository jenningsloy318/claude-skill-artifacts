## To Do

1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Move the documentation phase to follow code review and update the corresponding documents (specification, implementation plan, and summary).
   - docs-executor moved from Phase 8 to Phase 10
   - Sequential execution after code review
   - Implemented 2025-12-06

2. Implement separate commands for each phase to allow them to be run independently.
