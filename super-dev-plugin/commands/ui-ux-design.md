Create comprehensive UI/UX design specifications for features requiring user interfaces.

## Usage

```
/super-dev:ui-ux-design [UI requirements and user context]
```

## What This Command Does

1. **Analyzes user needs**: Understands user context and requirements
2. **Creates wireframes**: Designs interface layouts and structure
3. **Defines interactions**: Specifies user flows and interactions
4. **Establishes design tokens**: Creates consistent design system
5. **Plans responsive design**: Ensures cross-device compatibility
6. **Creates design spec**: Generates `[phase-index]-design-spec.md`
