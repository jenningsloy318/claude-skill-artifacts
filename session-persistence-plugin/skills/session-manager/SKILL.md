# Session Manager Skill

Manage session summaries created by the PreCompact hook.

## When to Activate

Use this skill when user:
- Asks about previous sessions ("what did we work on?", "show my sessions")
- Wants to list saved summaries ("list sessions", "session history")
- Needs to load specific context ("load the auth session", "restore previous work")
- Wants to search summaries ("find session about database")
- Asks about session management ("how many summaries", "delete old sessions")

## Directory Structure

Session summaries are stored in the project's `.claude/summaries/` directory:

```
.claude/summaries/
├── index.json                      # Global index of all summaries
└── {session_id}/
    ├── {timestamp}/
    │   ├── summary.md              # Human-readable summary
    │   └── metadata.json           # Machine-readable metadata
    └── latest -> {timestamp}       # Symlink to most recent
```

## Available Actions

### 1. List Sessions

Read `.claude/summaries/index.json` and present available sessions.

**Output format:**
```
## Available Session Summaries

| # | Session ID | Date | Trigger | Files Modified |
|---|------------|------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | abc123... | 2025-11-23 19:04 | auto | 15 |
| 2 | def456... | 2025-11-22 14:30 | manual | 3 |

Total: 2 sessions stored
```

### 2. Load Session

Load a specific session summary and optionally inject into context.

**Steps:**
1. Read summary from `.claude/summaries/{id}/{timestamp}/summary.md`
2. Read metadata from `.claude/summaries/{id}/{timestamp}/metadata.json`
3. Present to user
4. Ask if they want it injected into current context

**Context injection format:**
```xml
<previous-session-context>
[Summary content here]
</previous-session-context>
```

### 3. Search Sessions

Search through summaries by keyword or topic.

**Steps:**
1. Read index.json for session list
2. For each session, read summary.md
3. Search for matching keywords
4. Return ranked results

### 4. Session Statistics

Provide overview of stored sessions.

**Output:**
```
## Session Summary Statistics

- Total sessions: 15
- Total compactions: 23
- Most active project: /path/to/project
- Most common topics: #api, #authentication, #bugfix
- Storage used: ~2.3 MB
```

## Tool Usage

Use these tools to implement actions:

- **Read** - Read index.json and summary files
- **Glob** - Find summary files: `.claude/summaries/**/*.md`
- **Grep** - Search within summaries for keywords

## Response Guidelines

1. **Be concise** - Show tables/lists, not walls of text
2. **Show recent first** - Most recent sessions at top
3. **Truncate IDs** - Show first 8 chars of session IDs
4. **Include dates** - Always show human-readable dates
5. **Offer actions** - After listing, offer to load specific session

## Error Handling

- **No summaries directory**: "No session summaries found. Summaries are created automatically when context is compacted."
- **No index.json**: "Summary index not found. Run `/compact` to create your first summary."
- **Session not found**: "Session '{id}' not found. Available sessions: [list]"

## Integration with PreCompact Hook

This skill reads data created by the PreCompact hook (`~/.claude/hooks/precompact.py`).

**Index.json structure:**
```json
{
  "summaries": [
    {
      "session_id": "abc123...",
      "timestamp": "20251123_190448",
      "created_at": "2025-11-23T19:04:48Z",
      "trigger": "auto",
      "project": "/path/to/project",
      "files_modified": ["file1.py", "file2.ts"],
      "message_count": 150,
      "summary_path": "abc123.../20251123_190448/summary.md"
    }
  ],
  "last_session": "abc123..."
}
```

## Example Interactions

**User:** "What sessions do I have?"
**Response:** [List sessions table]

**User:** "Load the most recent session"
**Response:** [Show summary, ask about context injection]

**User:** "Find sessions about authentication"
**Response:** [Search and show matching sessions]

**User:** "How many summaries are stored?"
**Response:** [Show statistics]
