- **AI+SAST hybrid approaches** reduce false positives by up to 91% compared to standalone tools, with signal-to-noise ratio being the critical quality metric

## Best Practices

### Recommended Patterns

#### 1. Multi-Agent Architecture with Supervisory QA-Checker
- **Description:** Deploy multiple specialized reviewer agents with a supervisory agent that validates contributions against the original review question
- **Use when:** Comprehensive review across multiple dimensions (security, style, consistency, revision suggestions)
- **Source:** CodeAgent paper (arXiv:2402.02172)

#### 2. Specification-Aware Review
- **Description:** Ground all review feedback in the specification document, comparing implementation against stated requirements
- **Use when:** Validating that code implements what was specified, not just that it follows general best practices
- **Source:** dev-workflow requirements analysis, CodeAgent methodology

#### 3. Structured Feedback with Severity Tiers
- **Description:** Categorize all issues into severity tiers (Critical/High/Medium/Low/Info) with clear blocking thresholds
- **Use when:** Every review output to enable actionable prioritization
- **Source:** SonarQube Clean Code, superpowers:code-reviewer

#### 4. Git SHA-Based Diff Scoping
- **Description:** Use BASE_SHA and HEAD_SHA to precisely scope review to changed code only
- **Use when:** Reviewing incremental changes within a workflow
- **Source:** superpowers:requesting-code-review skill

#### 5. Actionable Feedback with Location + Suggestion + Rationale
- **Description:** Every issue must include exact location (file:line), concrete fix suggestion, and rationale explaining why it matters
- **Use when:** All review feedback to ensure developers can act immediately
- **Source:** Google eng-practices, Microsoft ISE guidance, Graphite AI best practices

#### 6. Signal-to-Noise Ratio as Primary Quality Metric
- **Description:** Measure review quality as (Tier1 + Tier2 issues) / Total comments. Target >60% signal ratio
- **Use when:** Evaluating and tuning review agent effectiveness
- **Source:** Industry research on AI code review noise (JetXu framework)

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### 1. Spamming Low-Value Suggestions
- **Description:** Generating many style/formatting comments that obscure critical issues
- **Why:** Research shows developers ignore tools with high noise; critical bugs get hidden among trivial suggestions
- **Source:** JetXu research on 22,000+ AI code review comments

#### 2. Generic Feedback Without Context
- **Description:** Providing boilerplate suggestions that don't reference the specific codebase patterns or specification
- **Why:** Misses the collaborative nature of code review; fails to verify design intent
- **Source:** CodeAgent paper, Google eng-practices

#### 3. Single-Pass Review Without Dimension Specialization
- **Description:** Attempting to review all aspects in one undifferentiated pass
- **Why:** Different dimensions (security, performance, correctness) require different mental models and expertise
- **Source:** CodeAgent multi-agent architecture, SonarQube modular rules

#### 4. Style-Only Focus
- **Description:** Reviewing only formatting/style while missing functional correctness
- **Why:** Automated linters handle style better; human/AI review should focus on logic, design, security
- **Source:** Microsoft ISE guidance, Google eng-practices

#### 5. Blocking on Non-Critical Issues
- **Description:** Preventing merge for minor style or preference issues
- **Why:** Slows velocity without improving code health; discourages future improvements
- **Source:** Google eng-practices ("favor approving once it definitely improves overall code health")

## Community Insights

### Top Discussions

1. **"Drowning in AI Code Review Noise"** - JetXu blog - Framework for measuring signal vs noise: Tier 1 (production failures), Tier 2 (maintainability issues), Tier 3 (subjective noise). Signal ratio <60% means tool is a noise generator.

2. **"Rethinking Code Review Workflows with LLM Assistance"** - WirelessCar/Chalmers study (arXiv:2505.16339v1) - Field experiment comparing AI-led vs on-demand LLM review; AI-led reviews preferred but conditional on reviewer familiarity with codebase and PR severity.

3. **"7 Habits of Highly Effective AI Coding"** - SonarSource - Developers are accountable for AI-generated code; mandatory unit tests and code analysis for all AI code; rigorous reviews remain essential.

4. **Superpowers Plugin Discussion** - obra/superpowers GitHub - code-reviewer skill returns structured feedback: Strengths, Issues (Critical/Important/Minor), Assessment. Mandatory after each task in subagent-driven-development.

5. **Prompt Engineering for Code Review** - Addy Osmani - Quality of AI output depends on quality of prompt; include context (project patterns, specification, constraints), be specific about what to review.

### Common Issues

**False Positives:** The #1 complaint with AI code review. Mitigated by:
- Combining AI with deterministic linters (91% reduction in one study)
- Strict severity categorization
- Learning from rejected suggestions
- Context-aware review (RAG pipelines for codebase context)

**Trust Issues:** Developers distrust AI reviews when:
- Suggestions are generic/not project-specific
- False positive rate is high
- AI doesn't understand the specification/requirements

**Context Switching:** Code review interrupts flow. Mitigated by:
- Automated summary of complex PRs
- Clear prioritization of issues
- On-demand vs proactive review modes

## Performance Considerations

### Benchmarks

| Metric | Source | Finding |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Review Time Impact | DORA Research | Teams with faster code reviews have 50% higher delivery performance |
| False Positive Reduction | SAST+LLM hybrid study | 91% reduction vs standalone SAST |
| Bug Detection | Code review research | Reviews during development reduce bugs by ~36% |
| Signal Ratio Target | JetXu framework | >60% signal (Tier 1+2 / Total) indicates effective review |

### Optimization Tips

1. **Incremental Review:** Review only changed code (git diff) rather than full files to reduce noise and focus attention
2. **Parallel Dimension Analysis:** Run security, performance, and correctness reviews in parallel where possible
3. **Static Analysis First:** Run linters/SAST before AI review to eliminate style issues that waste AI reasoning
4. **Caching:** Cache review results for unchanged code sections to avoid redundant analysis
5. **Severity-Based Processing:** Process Critical issues first to enable early blocking decisions

## Edge Cases

### Known Limitations

1. **Generated/Vendored Code:** AI reviewers may flag issues in generated code that shouldn't be manually modified
   - Solution: Exclude paths matching common generated patterns (.generated., /vendor/, /node_modules/)

2. **Large PRs:** AI context windows may struggle with very large changesets
   - Solution: Break into logical chunks; use summarization for context

3. **Language-Specific Idioms:** AI may not recognize valid idiomatic patterns in less common languages
   - Solution: Include language-specific examples in prompt; reference project patterns

4. **Security Review Depth:** LLMs may miss subtle security vulnerabilities that require deep domain expertise
   - Solution: Combine with specialized SAST tools (Snyk, CodeQL, Semgrep)

### Edge Cases to Handle

1. **Breaking Changes:** Code that changes public API signatures or database schemas
   - How to handle: Flag as Critical; require explicit acknowledgment; check for migration paths

2. **Performance Regressions:** Code that may degrade performance but is functionally correct
   - How to handle: Run benchmarks or request performance test evidence; flag as High if no evidence provided

3. **Test-Only Changes:** PRs that only modify tests
   - How to handle: Focus on test validity, coverage, and whether tests actually verify behavior

4. **Configuration Changes:** Changes to env files, CI configs, infrastructure-as-code
   - How to handle: Apply security review (no secrets exposed); verify changes match intended environment

5. **Merge Conflicts:** Code that was auto-merged and may have subtle integration issues
   - How to handle: Extra scrutiny on merge boundaries; verify logic remains coherent

### Security Considerations

Based on OWASP Code Review Guide and Secure Coding Practices:

| Category | What to Check |
|----------|---------------|
| Input Validation | All user inputs validated, sanitized, and constrained |
| Output Encoding | Proper encoding for context (HTML, SQL, URL, etc.) |
| Authentication | Secure password handling, session management, MFA where appropriate |
| Authorization | Access controls enforced at every layer |
| Cryptography | Strong algorithms, proper key management, no hardcoded secrets |
| Error Handling | Errors handled gracefully, no sensitive data in error messages |
| Data Protection | Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit |
| Injection Prevention | Parameterized queries, no string concatenation for commands |

## Recommendations

### Must Do

1. **Implement Specification-Aware Review:** The code-reviewer MUST read and reference the specification document, verifying acceptance criteria are met
2. **Structured Output with Severity:** Every issue MUST include: location, severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low/Info), category, description, suggestion, rationale
3. **Critical-Only Blocking:** Only Critical severity issues should block approval; this balances velocity with quality
4. **Tool Integration:** MUST integrate with project-specific linting and static analysis tools to avoid duplicating their work
5. **Actionable Feedback:** 100% of issues must have concrete remediation guidance

### Should Consider

1. **Multi-Pass Architecture:** Consider separate review passes for different dimensions (security, performance, correctness) for deeper analysis
2. **Pattern Learning:** Reference patterns from code-assessor to ensure consistency with existing codebase
3. **Research Integration:** Apply best practices from research-agent findings to the review
4. **Review History Tracking:** Track review iterations to learn from rejected suggestions
5. **Configurable Severity Thresholds:** Allow projects to customize what severity levels block approval

### Future Considerations

1. **Team-Specific Rules:** Support custom review rules per team/project
2. **CI/CD Integration:** Run as part of automated pipelines
3. **Metrics Dashboard:** Aggregate review metrics for quality insights
4. **Learning from Rejections:** Reduce false positives by learning from developer feedback
5. **Cross-Repository Pattern Learning:** Learn patterns across multiple repositories in an organization

## CodeAgent Architecture (Academic Reference)

The CodeAgent paper (arXiv:2402.02172) presents a multi-agent LLM system for code review with:

### Agent Structure
```
+-------------------------------------------+
|          Supervisory QA-Checker           |
|  (validates all agent contributions)      |
+-------------------------------------------+
         |              |              |
         v              v              v
+-------------+ +-------------+ +-------------+
| Consistency | | Security    | | Style       |
| Reviewer    | | Reviewer    | | Reviewer    |
+-------------+ +-------------+ +-------------+
         |              |              |
         v              v              v
+-------------------------------------------+
|           Revision Suggester              |
+-------------------------------------------+
```

### Four Review Tasks
1. **Consistency Detection:** Check if code changes are consistent with commit messages
2. **Vulnerability Detection:** Identify security vulnerabilities introduced by changes
3. **Style Verification:** Validate adherence to coding style guidelines
4. **Revision Suggestions:** Propose concrete code improvements

### Key Innovation
The supervisory QA-Checker agent ensures all contributions address the initial review question, preventing drift and maintaining focus.

## Static Analysis Integration Patterns

### Recommended Tool Stack

| Language | Linter | Formatter | SAST |
|----------|--------|-----------|------|
| TypeScript/JavaScript | ESLint, Biome | Prettier, Biome | Semgrep, Snyk |
| Python | Ruff, Pylint | Black, Ruff | Bandit, Semgrep |
| Rust | Clippy | rustfmt | cargo-audit |
| Go | golangci-lint | gofmt | gosec, Semgrep |

### Integration Strategy
1. **Pre-AI Phase:** Run deterministic linters/formatters first
2. **Incorporate Results:** Include linter output as context for AI review
3. **Avoid Duplication:** Don't have AI review what linters already catch
4. **Focus AI on:** Logic, design, specification compliance, subtle security issues

### Detection Pattern
```bash
# Detect project linting configuration
if [ -f "eslint.config.js" ] || [ -f ".eslintrc*" ]; then
    npm run lint 2>&1 | head -100
fi
if [ -f "pyproject.toml" ]; then
    ruff check . 2>&1 | head -100
fi
if [ -f "Cargo.toml" ]; then
    cargo clippy 2>&1 | head -100
fi
```
